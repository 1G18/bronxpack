basic controls and authorization system is the same as bronx pack so refer to the video/readme for that
the main changes are as follows:

1) removed the unsetup option and the bot teleports instantly instead of next round
2) fixed death barriers not working, all damage is normal execpt snipers are 1 shot and flooded water does no damages
3) host can give an ammo crate (limited to host to avoid spam) the bind is crouch + dpad up
4) on the 7th round the host will get a kem strike on spawn (score tied at 3-3)
5) refill ammo bind now refills tacticals

console commands you may want:
1) pm_bouncing (toggles depatch bounces)
2) g_enableelevators (toggles jump-crouch elevators)
3) spawnbot (spawns a bot)
