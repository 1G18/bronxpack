host only:
-crouch + dpad left = save bot spawn to crosshair (also toggles unsetup/setup mode)
-dna bomb can be called in on last round by proning, aiming in and pressing dpad up
(doesnt give to your inventory, just calls it in right away) 

all players:
-crouch + knife = refill ammo and exo
-crouch + dpad up = drop canswap
-dpad up = ripped energy turret

other notes:
-players are auto autorized by team, always pick sentinel
-bots cannot plant or defuse bombs
-the config file still exists but it is only for picking prestige
-equip an explosive drone and it will be swapped out for right hand throwing knives (need flak jacket perk to cancel them)
-equip exo overclock to get a grapple hook (only works on grapple maps)
